      <h1>What are Progressive Web Apps?</h1>
      <p>If you have this question, you're not alone! Many people have started
        to notice this concept popping up more and more. Simply put: <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps?hl=en" id="quote">"Progressive Web Apps use modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like user experience"</a></p>
      <p>In practice that means your web appication loads instantly, has push notifications, can be added to a user's mobile device home screen, and is fast, secure, and reliable. Since it is web-based, and not a native application, it should also be responsive and look great regardless of the screen or device that's viewing it.</p>
      <p> For more information, such as Case Studies (AliExpress increasing conversion rate 104% by implementing a PWA,  Konga cutting data usage by 94%, and more), examples, and codelabs about PWAs, check out our page on the <a id="quote" href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/">Google Developers site</a>, or this well-sourced <a id="quote" href="https://github.com/TalAter/awesome-progressive-web-apps">Github page.</a></p>
      <p> To get inspired by cool PWAs made by other people, check out <a id="quote" href="https://pwa.rocks/">pwa.rocks</a> or <a href="polymon.polymer-project.org" id="quote">Polymon</a> which is a PWA cooked up by some members on the Polymer team.</p>


      <h1>Why make Progressive Web Apps?</h1>
      <p>From O'Reilly's Building Progressive Web Apps, "Progressive web apps are a new breed of web apps. They combine the benefits of a native app with the low friction nature of the web. Progressive web apps start off as simple websites, but as the user interacts with them, they progressively gain new powers. They transform from a website into something much more like a traditional native app."</p>
      <p>With more and more people accessing the internet on smartphones rather than desktop computers, there is only an increasing need to cater to the mobile web. If everyone were to build their web apps as Progressive Web Apps, there is not a major need to create specific mobile apps for every available platform. You would build once and deploy everywhere. </p>

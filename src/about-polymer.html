      <h1>What is Polymer?</h1>
      <p>Web development can be broken down into two essential parts: back end and front end.</p>
      <p>The back end is where the server is located. It typically handles operations such as serving
        web pages, serving components, responding to fetch requests and authentication, or basically 
        anything you can't see when you view the website in a browser. Popular back end frameworks 
        and platforms include Node.js, Django, and Ruby on Rails. If you follow along with our tutorials,
        you'll be using Node.js.
      </p>
      <p>The front end is built with web pages; the front end is sometimes referred to as the UI, or User 
        Interface, which a user sees and interacts with. This is the code that does not run on the server, but
        on the browser. The front end controls how the user navigates within the page and around the app, communicates
        with the back end via HTTP requests, and much more. <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/">Polymer</a>
        is a front end library built by engineers at Google that offers an easier way to create beautiful,
        responsive web apps.
      </p>
      <p>Polymer focuses on <a href="http://webcomponents.org/">Web Components</a>. 
         Web Components incorporate 4 innovative web technologies:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Shadow DOM</strong> encapsulates HTML so that you can focus on smaller parts of code and
        not worry about other parts of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a>
        interfering with your component. Say goodbye to pesky CSS bugs!</li>
          <li><strong>HTML Templating</strong> is a standard built into HTML that allows you to create templates, so you can write 
          reusable chunks of code and borrow great stuff from other people as well.</li>
          <li><strong>HTML Imports</strong> allow you to link an HTML file/template to another HTML file just like you
          would for a css or js file. </li>
          <li><strong>Custom Elements</strong> are created by adding a dash in a template definition ("my-element") and then using the element in any HTML file with a corresponding HTML tag ("&lt;my-element&gt;&lt;/my-element&gt;") </li>
          <li>For a catalog of awesome open source Custom Elements, check out <a href="https://www.webcomponents.org/">webcomponents.org</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>With Polymer, you can create many encapsulated Web Components to use, reuse, and
        hook together, so you can easily make something super powerful with just a few lines of HTML.
        The great thing about encapsulated Web Components is that you can use them in almost any project 
        or framework! They are modular, and because they are standardized across the web, they <i>just work</i> 
        in any project.
      </p>

      <h1>Why use Polymer?</h1>
      <p>It all comes down to this: It's easy!</p>
      <p>Building web applicaitons with Polymer has never been easier. Polymer allows you to
        encapsulate many parts of your webpage in usable, reusable, modular Web Components. Here is
        an example of the <code>sign-here</code> element:</p>
      <div class="centerDemoWrapper">
        <demo-snippet>
          <template>
            <style>
              sign-here {
                display: inline-block;
                border: solid black 1px;
              }
            </style>
            <sign-here width="250" height="200"></sign-here>
          </template>
        </demo-snippet>
      </div>

      <p>This element allows you to sign in a box with your mouse or touch, but the only thing
        we had to implement was an html import, and put the element tag in there with some starting
        parameters. Polymer makes complex code simple and encapsulated.</p>
      
      <h2>Data Binding</h2>
      <p>Polymer also makes it easy to share data across your app. One way we are able to do this is
        via data binding</p>
      
      <div class="centerDemoWrapper">
        <demo-snippet>
          <template is="dom-bind">
            <div>Your input is: [[variableName]]</div>
            <paper-input value="{{variableName}}" label="Two-way binding"></paper-input>
            <paper-input value="[[variableName]]" label="One-way binding"></paper-input>
          </template>
        </demo-snippet>
      </div>
      
      <h2>Custom Elements</h2>
      <p>If there isn't an element that solves your issue, you can create your own with its own
        properties. In the following demo, we have created a simple element called
        <code>themed-youtube</code> which is a small themed, reusable container that allows you to
        set the color, video, and header title. It is even possible to data-bind to these values.</p>
      <div>Source code for this demo can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/e111077/384e0b82925cffe6b2472479dc387e82">here</a>.</div>
      <div class="centerDemoWrapper">
        <themed-youtube color="#1976D2"></themed-youtube>
        <themed-youtube color="#FF5252" video-id="EIyixC9NsLI" header="{{badgerHeader}}"></themed-youtube>
        <themed-youtube color="#757575" video-id="J4i0xJnQUzU" header="Polymer@I/O"></themed-youtube>
        <themed-youtube color="#212121" video-id="gCjge4cRFE0" header="PUPPIES!!"></themed-youtube>
      </div>
      
      <paper-input value="{{badgerHeader}}" label="badger header"></paper-input>
      
    </div>
  </template>

  <script>

    Polymer({

      is: 'about-polymer',

      properties: {
        badgerHeader: {
          type: String,
          value: 'this is the default header'
        }
      }
    });

  </script>
